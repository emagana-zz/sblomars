          folder.

	* Where it says "user@$node:/home/upc_sblomars/" replace "user" for your remote node
          user account. Replace "/home/upc_sblomars/" for the path in remote node where
	  Sblomars will be copyied. 
	  
_deploy_sblomars.sh:

	* In the command line "ssh user@$node "cd /path_to_Sblomars/Sblomars/ && nohup sh final_sblomars.sh > /dev/null" &"
	  replace "user" for your remote node user account. Replace /path_to_Sblomars/ 
	  for the path of the Sblomars folder.

If you are going to use BLOMERS you should edit sblomars.conf configuration file, in the line containing

Then stop SBLOMARS and run it again

___SOME HINTS___

	* copying_directory.sh file allows to copy SBLOMARS folder to a list of nodes listed in nodes.txt at the same time.
	* deploy_sblomars.sh file starts the execution of SBLOMARS in all nodes listed in nodes.txt.
	* images.sh file enables the transmission of graphical reports between the node and the node-visor(server)
	* stop_sblomars.sh stops the execution of SBLOMARS in all nodes.
	
___MORE ABOUT SBLOMARS'S CONFIGURATION FILES RELATED WITH BLOMERS___

SBLOMARS makes use of some configuration files that allow SBLOMARS to comunicate
with BLOMERS giving information, others just gives information and some others stablished a policy.
In SBLOMARS there are basically three configuration files:

● sblomars.conf 
● snmpd.conf
● ports.conf

One of these three files is “ports.conf”: It contains the name of device, host, and port in which will be sended some related information, like
parameters of the device (number of free space in memory, one of the cases of Memory Agent).

“snmpd.conf”:
It contains the needed information for the correct use of snmp

“sblomars.conf”:
It contains the host and port used from the Resource Manager devices. Its function is allowing communication
between SBLOMARS and BLOMERS throught a socket connection in which SBLOMARS sends the ip of its host as an ip request.
